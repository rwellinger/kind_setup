# Install nginx ingress controller

This will setup NGINX as a ingress controller and allow you to access services on KIND over ingress.

    kubectl apply -f ingress-nginx-deploy.yaml

This is used as described on KIND Webpage. So you can just check the website there. Maybe the ingress deployment script there is already newer ...
